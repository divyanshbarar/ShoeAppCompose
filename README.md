# Jetpack Compose Animation UI

Hey All, this project is all about Jetpack Compose Animation and creating visually rich UI.
In one of the first we have created a simple Shoe app with three screens and added different UI interactions using compose animation API's.
Will be adding more in future with difference use cases.
